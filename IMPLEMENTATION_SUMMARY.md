## Data Relationships & Architecture

### Term Integration Architecture
```
Term (Settings)
    ├── LearningMaterial (Many-to-One)
    ├── FeePayment (Many-to-One)  
    ├── FeeStructure (Many-to-One)
    └── Enrollment (Many-to-One)
```

### Fee Analytics Data Flow
```
Student Enrollment → Fee Structure → Expected Fees
                                       ↓
Fee Payments → Actual Payments → Analytics Calculations
                                       ↓
Dashboard Data → Payment Rates → Class Performance
```

### Logging Architecture
```
System Events → SystemLoggingService → Log Entity → Database
                     ↓
Module-Specific Methods → Contextual Logging → Audit Trail
```
