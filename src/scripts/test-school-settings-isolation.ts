/**
 * Test Script: School Settings Isolation
 * 
 * This script verifies that:
 * 1. Each school admin can only access their own school's settings
 * 2. School settings are properly isolated by schoolId
 * 3. SUPER_ADMIN users cannot access school-specific settings
 */

// Example usage scenarios:

// Scenario 1: Admin from School A updates their school settings
const adminSchoolA = {
  sub: 'admin-a-id',
  email: 'admin@schoola.com',
  role: 'ADMIN',
  schoolId: 'school-a-uuid'
};

const schoolASettings = {
  schoolSettings: {
    schoolName: 'Green Valley High School',
    schoolEmail: 'info@greenvalley.edu',
    schoolPhone: '+1-555-0123',
    schoolAddress: '123 Education Blvd, City, State',
    schoolAbout: 'Excellence in education since 1950'
  }
};

// Scenario 2: Admin from School B updates their school settings
const adminSchoolB = {
  sub: 'admin-b-id',
  email: 'admin@schoolb.com',
  role: 'ADMIN',
  schoolId: 'school-b-uuid'
};

const schoolBSettings = {
  schoolSettings: {
    schoolName: 'Riverside Academy',
    schoolEmail: 'contact@riverside.edu',
    schoolPhone: '+1-555-0456',
    schoolAddress: '456 River Road, Town, State',
    schoolAbout: 'Nurturing minds for the future'
  }
};

// Scenario 3: SUPER_ADMIN should not have access to school settings
const superAdmin = {
  sub: 'super-admin-id',
  email: 'super@system.com',
  role: 'SUPER_ADMIN',
  schoolId: null // Super admins don't belong to any specific school
};

console.log('School Settings Isolation Test Scenarios:');
console.log('1. Admin A can only see and update School A settings');
console.log('2. Admin B can only see and update School B settings');
console.log('3. Super Admin cannot access individual school settings');
console.log('4. Each school\'s settings are completely isolated');

// Test API endpoints:
// GET /api/v1/settings - Returns school settings only for the admin's school
// PATCH /api/v1/settings - Updates school settings only for the admin's school
