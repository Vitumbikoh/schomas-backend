  Based on the analysis, here are the recommended fixes:

  A. Fix Teacher ID References:
     UPDATE exam

     WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM teacher t WHERE t."userId" = exam."teacherId");

  B. Fix Missing School IDs:
     UPDATE exam e
     SET "schoolId" = COALESCE(
       (SELECT t."schoolId" FROM teacher t WHERE t.id = e."teacherId"),
       (SELECT c."schoolId" FROM classes c WHERE c.id = e."classId"),
       (SELECT co."schoolId" FROM course co WHERE co.id = e."courseId")
     )
     WHERE e."schoolId" IS NULL;

  C. Verify Academic Year Relations:
     SELECT 
       e.id, 
       e.title, 
       e."academicYearId",
       ay.id as academic_year_exists
     FROM exam e
     LEFT JOIN academic_year ay ON e."academicYearId" = ay.id
     WHERE ay.id IS NULL;
  `);
